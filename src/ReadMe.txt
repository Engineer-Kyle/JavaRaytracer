Hello, here is my log.

PROBLEM: For some reason the file writing is incomplete. The last 28 pixels are not written to
the file.

RANDOM: My code ends at "Scans remaining: 176". I don't know if this is related to the other
problem of ending prematurely but maybe.

TODO: What the heck does the scatter Ray do in materials? IDK

CURRENT: After trying to implement chp 10, something broke and sent everything to black.
After lots of debugging, lots  of stuff is broke. I am going to comment out tons of stuff
until I get it back to chapter 9 functionality.

Man: That is a depressing log. After much work over thangsgiving break, I have
succussfully implemented everything needed to pass the class and then some minus the BVH
structure. I have to figure this out by friday.

Currently it can only render 5 objects. If I had more ojects, other objects would disappear.
